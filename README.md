## Motivation

RatedRentals started because trying to find an rental home which best fit your preferences takes a lot of time and is difficult to search for. You have to go through an abundance of listings on rental listings websites. You may be thinking: what about using the filters (location, price etc.) on these website to narrow our search of listings? Well, if you ever try these filters, you would know that they don't work out the way you expect. The search gets narrowed so precisely to what you asked to filtered (and that's what it's supposed to do) that you get such few listings that may not be the ones you are looking for or like.
